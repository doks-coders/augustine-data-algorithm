# Introduction to Data Structure & Algorithm

Data Structure and Algorithm basically is about the science of how Data can be
stored, structured and traversed. The larger the sample size of the data, the more
you would need efficient algorithms to traverse this structures.

The idea around Data structure is, what are the finite ways for which large amount of
data can be structured (stored), and what are the ways we can get/read the needed
data out when we need it.


## Some Data Structures include:
- Arrays - Use arrays when you need a collection of elements with indexed access
and fast operations like insertion and deletion at the end.
- Linked Lists - Use linked lists when you need efficient insertion and deletion at
any position, but indexed access is not a priority.
- Stacks - Use stacks when you require a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure, such
as in managing function calls or implementing undo/redo functionality.
- Queues - Use queues when you need a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure, like
processing tasks in order or implementing breadth-first search.
- Hash Tables - Use hash tables when you need fast key-value pair lookups or
efficient duplicate detection.
- Trees - Use trees for hierarchical structures, such as binary trees, binary search
trees, or balanced trees like AVL or Red-Black trees.
- Graphs - Use graphs when you need to represent connections between
elements or solve problems involving networks, paths, or traversals.
